Hey thereðŸ‘‹ My name is Berk Hakbilen. I am currently working as a data scientist. I transitioned into a career into data science after discovering my passion for data and developing myself in the field of data science as a hobby. During this transition, free online material available was a huge help for me. That's why I decided to create this blog, to publish some of the free learning material that I have created in my free time, so that it can be helpful for others who are interested about data science! 

I hope this material is useful for you. If you have any questions or feedback, feel free to contact me!
